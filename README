NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Eliza - Eliza for
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This module is a simple wrapper around
    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Chatbot-Eliza>.

        $bot->load('Eliza');

FUNCTIONS
  help
    Prints a helpful message.

  fallback
    Replies to messages directed to the bot instance. We are using fallback
    just to make sure that this very talkative module does not interfere
    with any other module.

  init
    Initializes the eliza module. Please refer to the documentation section
    VARIABLES for configuration settings.

  set / unset
    These functions are subclassed to reload the eliza instance after the
    scriptfile is changed. The normal beaviour of Chatbot::Eliza is to
    simply add the rules of the new scriptfile to the current scriptfile
    rules, which is often not the expected behaviour (at least by the
    expectations of the author). In case scriptfile is unset, we reload the
    eliza instance to access it's default Rogerian psychotherapist.

    Both functions reset the phrases remembered by the
    %reasmblist_for_memory structure.

VARIABLES
  scriptfile
    The chatbot uses the tranformation rules in this file to reply. Please
    refer to <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Chatbot-Eliza> for its syntax.
